- As a manager, I oversee all project delivery, prioritize, guide, direct, and monitor the work efforts of Infrastructure Project Managers and Technical teams. I track, report, and resolve issues in a timely manner to ensure project delivery. I also manage capital expenditures and related expense budgets and work with IT Finance and vendors to ensure architected technologies are procured in a coordinated and timely fashion.

I attract and retain talent through positive employee relations and robust succession planning. I also manage the technology direction and tools of the team, ensuring that appropriate standards are set, maintained, followed, and reported on regularly.
- With my working experience with a broad range of Infrastructure solutions for both B2B and B2C related technologies and technical experience including designing, installing, integrating, implementing, and supporting multiple versions of application and infrastructure components, I drive to ensure that SLA‚Äôs exist across all service platforms and that BAU activities remain within the stated SLA‚Äôs and also oversee and coordinate PTO ‚ÄòPermit to Operate‚Äô programs related to supported portfolio of applications.

- I foster productive relationships with consulting partners, defining clear expectations for communication and performance and ensure projects satisfy all documented requirements and are delivered on-time, within scope, and within budget. I assist in establishing scope, level of effort, and budget for stakeholder-initiated projects, organize and prioritize projects to maximize return on development efforts, direct multiple active work streams across multifunctional teams and effectively lead a team composed of Team Members and contractors in support of product development, operations, and maintenance.
- I review and evaluate vendors‚Äô work deliverables (SDS), to ensure the System Requirements are met and apply collaboration and listening skills when interacting with clients to ensure their needs are properly understood.
